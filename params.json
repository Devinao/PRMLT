{"name":"PRMLT","tagline":"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning Toolbox ","body":"### Welcome to PRMLT\r\nThis a Matlab package which implemented the algorithms described in the classical machine learning textbook [PRML](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/prml/) (Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning). The package is self-contained and purely Matlab based, there is no outside package dependency and no mex-based native (like C++) code inside.\r\n\r\nThe code is heavily commented and the symbols are synced with the book, in order to make code easy to read and learn.\r\n\r\n### Installation and Usage\r\n\r\n(1) Download the zip file above and extract it wherever you want. \r\n\r\n(2) Navigate Matlab to package location as working directory and run the init.m script. \r\n\r\n(3) Play with any function in the package.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis package was basically written by [me](https://github.com/sth4nth). It still need to be polished and refined, especially for documentation and test cases. Help are needed and contributions are welcome.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact:\r\n\r\nsth4nth at gmail dot com","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
