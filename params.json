{"name":"PRMLT","tagline":"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning Toolbox ","body":"### Welcome to PRMLT\r\nThis a Matlab package which implemented the algorithms described in the classical machine learning textbook [PRML](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/prml/) (Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning). The package is self-contained and purely Matlab based, there is no outside package dependency and no mex-based native (like C++) code inside.\r\n\r\nThe code is heavily commented and the symbols are synced with the book, in order to make code easy to read and learn.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis package was basically written by [me](https://github.com/sth4nth). It still need to be polished and refined, especially for documentation and test cases. Help are needed and contributions are welcome.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact:\r\n\r\nsth4nth at gmail dot com","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
